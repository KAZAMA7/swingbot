# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing NIFTY trading bot to fetch stock data from inception (maximum available historical data) and fixes command line input handling in the binary version. The current implementation has limitations in data fetching periods and the binary doesn't properly accept command line arguments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to analyze stocks using their complete historical data from inception, so that I can make more informed trading decisions based on long-term patterns and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching stock data THEN the system SHALL attempt to retrieve maximum available historical data using "max" period first
2. WHEN "max" period fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to progressively shorter periods ("10y", "5y", "2y", "1y", "6mo")
3. WHEN data is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL log the actual date range and number of years of data obtained
4. WHEN analyzing stocks THEN the system SHALL display the historical data span for each symbol in the output
5. IF a stock has less than 1 year of data THEN the system SHALL warn the user about limited historical context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the binary version, I want to provide command line arguments to the executable, so that I can configure the bot's behavior without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the binary THEN the system SHALL ensure all command line argument parsing is properly included
2. WHEN running the binary with --help THEN the system SHALL display all available command line options
3. WHEN running the binary with arguments like --size, --test, --verbose THEN the system SHALL process these arguments correctly
4. WHEN the binary encounters argument parsing errors THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
5. IF the binary is run without arguments THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and display current configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced data fetching to be configurable, so that I can control the maximum data period when needed for testing or performance reasons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the bot THEN the system SHALL allow setting a maximum data period in configuration files
2. WHEN max_data_period is set in config THEN the system SHALL respect this limit instead of using "max"
3. WHEN no max_data_period is configured THEN the system SHALL default to fetching maximum available data
4. WHEN data fetching takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and timeout handling
