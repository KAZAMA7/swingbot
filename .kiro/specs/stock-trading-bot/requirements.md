# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a cross-platform stock swing trading bot that automatically fetches global equity data, performs technical analysis using RSI, Bollinger Bands, and EMA indicators, and generates actionable buy/sell signals. The system will be packaged as a single executable for Windows, Mac, and Linux, with automated scheduling and extensible architecture for future enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a swing trader, I want the system to automatically fetch real-time and historical stock data from free APIs, so that I can analyze current market conditions without manual data collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to Yahoo Finance API via yfinance library
2. WHEN a stock symbol is added to the watchlist THEN the system SHALL fetch OHLCV data for that symbol
3. WHEN new market data is available THEN the system SHALL store it in local SQLite database
4. IF API connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry after configured interval
5. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve at least 200 days of price history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to calculate technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMA) on my watchlist stocks, so that I can identify potential trading opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new price data arrives THEN the system SHALL calculate RSI with configurable period (default 14)
2. WHEN new price data arrives THEN the system SHALL calculate Bollinger Bands with configurable parameters (default 20-period, 2 standard deviations)
3. WHEN new price data arrives THEN the system SHALL calculate EMA with configurable period (default 20)
4. WHEN calculations complete THEN the system SHALL store indicator values with timestamps
5. IF insufficient data exists for calculations THEN the system SHALL log warning and skip signal generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a swing trader, I want the system to generate buy/sell signals based on technical analysis rules, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RSI < 30 AND price closes below Bollinger lower band AND price is above EMA THEN the system SHALL generate BUY signal
2. WHEN RSI > 70 AND price closes above Bollinger upper band AND price is below EMA THEN the system SHALL generate SELL signal
3. WHEN signal conditions are not met THEN the system SHALL record NO SIGNAL state
4. WHEN signal is generated THEN the system SHALL log it with timestamp and stock symbol
5. WHEN signal thresholds are changed in config THEN the system SHALL apply new rules immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to run automatically on a schedule, so that I can receive updated signals without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system starts THEN it SHALL begin scheduled updates at configured interval (default 5 minutes)
2. WHEN scheduled update triggers THEN the system SHALL fetch data for all watchlist stocks
3. WHEN manual update is requested THEN the system SHALL immediately process all stocks
4. WHEN update cycle completes THEN the system SHALL log completion time and processed stock count
5. IF system encounters errors during scheduled run THEN it SHALL continue with next scheduled update

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want all signals and analysis results saved to files, so that I can review historical performance and track signal accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signal is generated THEN the system SHALL save it to CSV file with timestamp, symbol, signal type, and indicator values
2. WHEN system runs THEN it SHALL maintain SQLite database of all historical data and signals
3. WHEN plotting option is enabled THEN the system SHALL generate matplotlib charts showing price and indicators
4. WHEN system starts THEN it SHALL create output directory if it doesn't exist
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL log error and continue operation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have modular architecture with clear interfaces, so that I can easily add new indicators, data sources, or trading strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new indicator module is added THEN it SHALL implement standard indicator interface
2. WHEN new data source is added THEN it SHALL implement standard data fetcher interface
3. WHEN new signal logic is added THEN it SHALL implement standard strategy interface
4. WHEN system loads THEN it SHALL discover and initialize all available modules
5. WHEN module fails to load THEN the system SHALL log error and continue with available modules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to run the trading bot as a single executable file on Windows, Mac, or Linux, so that I can deploy it easily without installing dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PyInstaller builds the application THEN it SHALL create single executable for each target OS
2. WHEN executable runs on target OS THEN it SHALL function identically across platforms
3. WHEN executable starts THEN it SHALL run with 2GB RAM or less
4. WHEN executable encounters missing dependencies THEN it SHALL include all required libraries
5. WHEN user runs executable THEN it SHALL create default config file if none exists

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to configure all system parameters through a configuration file, so that I can customize the bot's behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system starts THEN it SHALL load parameters from config.yaml file
2. WHEN config file is modified THEN the system SHALL reload settings on next cycle
3. WHEN invalid config values are detected THEN the system SHALL use defaults and log warnings
4. WHEN config file is missing THEN the system SHALL create default configuration
5. WHEN user specifies custom config path THEN the system SHALL use that file instead of default
