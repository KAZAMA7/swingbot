Technical Specification: Cross-Platform Stock Swing Trading Bot
1. Project Overview
Objective: Create a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) executable application that regularly fetches global equity financial data, analyzes signals using RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMA, and provides actionable swing trading buy/sell signals with room for improvement and extensibility.

Executable: The program must be compiled into a single binary for each OS using PyInstaller.

Automation: The binary will fetch new market data and update signals periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).

2. Functional Requirements
a. Data Ingestion
Connect to free APIs (like Yahoo Finance via yfinance) and/or Stockdex to fetch OHLCV equity data for user-specified watchlists.

Provide support for fetching real-time and/or end-of-day quotes.

Historical and current data must be stored (e.g., SQLite or lightweight JSON/CSV storage).

b. Technical Analysis Module
Use ta-lib or ta Python libraries to compute:

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Bollinger Bands (Upper, Lower, and Width)

Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

Calculations should be updated whenever new price data arrives.

c. Buy/Sell Signal Logic
Signal logic is as follows (configurable thresholds):

BUY signal: RSI < 30, Price closes below Bollinger Band lower, Price above EMA confirmation.

SELL signal: RSI > 70, Price closes above Bollinger Band upper, Price below EMA confirmation.

All rules and indicator parameters should be set via configuration file for easy tuning.

d. Trend and Pattern Analysis
Calculate and store recent price trends, including:

Detecting crossovers of EMA with price

Noting squeeze/constriction in Bollinger Bands for volatility insights.

Add extensible hooks for future chart pattern modules (Head & Shoulders, Double Top, etc.).

e. Automation and Scheduling
The program must automatically update all stocks on a schedule (interval configurable, e.g., 5min, 15min).

Optionally support manual trigger for immediate update.

f. Output and Alerts
Log all BUY/SELL/NO SIGNAL states with timestamps.

Output historical and current signals to a file (CSV or SQLite), human-readable summary, and optionally email/notification in next iterations.

Provide basic charts of indicator overlays using matplotlib when run with plotting option.

g. Modularity and Extensibility
All strategies, data sources, and indicators should be implemented in independent modules.

Clear documented interfaces for adding new indicators, patterns, or data sources.

3. Non-Functional & System Requirements
Cross-platform: Must build and run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Single-executable: Distribute as a self-contained .exe and Unix binary.

Resource efficient: Should run on systems with 2GB RAM, low CPU usage.

Should expose clear logs for debugging and future improvement.

4. Technologies and Libraries
Python 3.8+

Market Data: yfinance (Yahoo! Finance), Stockdex (optional).

Technical Analysis: ta, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

Scheduling: schedule or APScheduler.

Packaging: PyInstaller.

Storage: sqlite3 or flat-file (allow for easy migration).

6. Room for Improvement
Add hooks for ML-based signal generation using Python ML stack.

Integrate additional data sources (Alpha Vantage, broker APIs).

Extend notification functionality (email, SMS, push notifications).

Allow user-defined strategies via plugins.

This specification fully defines the input/output, architecture, and core algorithms to build a robust, modular, and extensible swing trading executable powered by technical analysis and primed for iterative AI-driven improvements.
